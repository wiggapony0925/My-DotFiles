This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring various tools and applications on my system. 

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/<username>/dotfiles.git


2. Run the installation script:

This script will create symbolic links for each dotfile in your home directory. Note that any existing dotfiles in your home directory will be overwritten!
